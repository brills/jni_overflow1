\subsection*{Abstract}
We look into the issue that the amount of entropy kept by the pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) of Android is constantly low. We find that the accusation again this issue of low entropy of causing poor performance and low frame rate experienced by users is ungrounded. We also investigate possible security vulnerabilities resulting from this issue. We find that this issue does not affect the quality of random numbers that are generated by the PRNG and used in Android applications. However, we identify a vulnerability by which an attacker could nullify the stack protecting mechanism, as known as stack canary, given the knowledge of the time of boot or a malicious app running on the victim device. This vulnerability also affects the address space layout randomization (ALSR) mechanism on Android, and can turn it from a weak protection to void.
